# CPU Scheduling
This project proposes and implements a greedy task scheduling algorithm for a Comptuer Cluster. As the input we have been given:
1- Each Machine's proccessors speed in MIPS (Million of Instructions Per Second)
2- A dependency matrix that defines the tasks required to be executed before each task 
3- Each task's size in MI (Million Instructions)

Our goal is to optimize for lowering the lognest runing machine's execution time.
